## What it is
ElectronOBD is a simple but modern-style desktop app that I made for displaying ECU sensor data from your car to a laptop screen in real-time with the option to export to CSV file afterwards for machine learning purposes. It is only supported on Windows for now and not packaged into an .exe file, but I was able to get the results I wanted from it, so I thought it was a good time to show it off.

## The motivation
Turns out the goddamn connection doesnt work if your car has bluetooth on!!!!
